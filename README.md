=============

Solver for Hardy-Weinberg problems, Python 3 is reccomended, but 2.7 will work


Run it as shown:

python3 hwe.py [size] [people with recessive gene] [flags]

Flags:
-d makes it calculate for dominant genes instead of recessive genes.  
-n makes it not round
-p expresses the numbers as percentages
