=============

Solver for Hardy-Weinberg problems, Python 3 is reccomended, but 2.7 will work


Run it as shown:

python3 hwe.py [size] [people affected with a recessive gene] [flags]

Flags:  
-d makes it so that the affected people are affected with a dominant gene
-n makes it not round  
-p expresses the numbers as percentages
